            <p>Hey guys, welcome to my site. I am a sport physiotherapist who specialized in
            the musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sport injury prevention. I am a professional
            athletic trainer licensed by the Department of Health, State of Washington. I worked
            at several places including Bethany Lutheran College and Seattle Children's Hospital.
            </p>

            <p>
            I obtained PhD in rehabilitation science from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, 
            University of Washington. My research is primarily focusd on the clinical gait analysis, 
            anthropometrics' influence on neuromuscular control during physical activity, and enegy 
            expenditure of locomotion. My research heavily relies on the methods of biomechanics.
            </p>

            <p>I was interested in engineering and mathematics while i was an undergraduate kinesiology 
                student. I took many math and engineering courses, all of which lead to my path in 
                rehabilitation medicine and biomechanics. I obtained MS in applied mathematics from 
                the university washington with specialization in data science and dynamic system analysis.
